In F#, it is possible to organize code within namespaces in a hierarchical manner by using nested namespaces. A nested namespace is a namespace that is defined within another namespace.

To declare a nested namespace, the keyword `namespace` is used followed by the identifier of the parent namespace, and then the nested namespace is defined using the `namespace` keyword again followed by the identifier of the nested namespace. 

For example:
```fsharp
namespace ParentNamespace
    namespace ChildNamespace
        //Code here belongs to ChildNamespace
    namespace AnotherChildNamespace
        //Code here belongs to AnotherChildNamespace
```

It's important to note that nested namespaces inherit the parent namespace identifier, therefore the full name of the nested namespace will be `ParentNamespace.ChildNamespace`.

Using nested namespaces can be beneficial when trying to organize large code bases and to avoid naming conflicts. It allows you to create a more structured and organized namespace hierarchy that reflects the organization of the code itself. This makes it easier to understand the codebase, and it also makes it easier to find and use the specific code that is needed.

Additionally, nested namespaces also help to control the visibility of types, since types defined in a nested namespace are only visible within the parent namespace and its nested namespaces, unless they are explicitly made visible by using the `open` keyword.

It's worth mentioning that you can use any number of nested namespaces, but it is important to use them judiciously to avoid over-complicating the codebase and make it harder to understand and maintain.

One example of using nested modules in F# is creating a module for a specific functionality within a larger module that represents a larger project or library. For example, let's say we have a project called "FinancialApp" and within that project, we have a module called "Calculations". Within the "Calculations" module, we can create a nested module called "Investments" that contains functions specific to investment calculations.

```fsharp
module FinancialApp

module Calculations
    module Investments
        let calculateROI (investment:float) (returns:float) = 
            (returns - investment) / investment
    let calculateLoanPayment (principal:float) (rate:float) (term:int) = 
        let r = rate / 12.0
        let t = float term
        (principal * r) / (1.0 - (1.0 + r) ** (-t))
```

We can call the functions in the nested module as follow:

```fsharp
let myInvestment = 1000.0
let myReturns = 1100.0
let roi = FinancialApp.Calculations.Investments.calculateROI myInvestment myReturns
```

Nesting modules in this way can help keep our code organized and make it easier to find and use specific functionality within a larger project.
